# 🔐 Arduino Password Door Lock System

This project is a simple password-protected door lock system using an Arduino UNO, 4x4 keypad, servo motor, and an LED. The system unlocks the door (servo rotates) only when the correct password is entered via the keypad. It's perfect for beginners learning Arduino and basic security applications.
